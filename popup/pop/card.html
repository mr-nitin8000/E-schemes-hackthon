      <h2>Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi</h2>
      <h4>Details</h4>
      <br />
      <h5>Objective</h5>
      <p>
        The scheme aims to supplement the financial needs of all landholding
        farmers families in procuring various inputs to ensure proper crop
        health and appropriate yields, commensurate with the anticipated farm
        income as well as for domestic needs. Under the Scheme an amount of
        Rs.6000/- per year is released by the Central Government online directly
        into the bank accounts of the eligible farmers under Direct Benefit
        Transfer mode, subject to certain exclusions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Benefits and Eligibility conditions</h5>
      <p>
        1. All land holding eligible farmer families (subject to the prevalent
        exclusion criteria) are to avail of the benefits under this scheme, as
        per the cabinet decision taken in May 2019. The revised Scheme is
        expected to cover around 2 crores more farmers, increasing the coverage
        of PM-KISAN to around 14.5 crore beneficiaries.
        <br />
        2. Under the scheme, financial benefit has been provided to all Small
        and Marginal landholder farmer families with total cultivable holding
        upto 2 hectares with a benefit of Rs.6000 per annum per family payable
        in three equal installments, every four months.
